# Angela Pogoda's Portfolio

### <u>**Description**</u>
HTML and SCSS have been used throughout my portfolio website.



### <u>**Challenges**</u>



Footer - My original goal was to have the footer halved and to have the GitHub and LinkedIn social media icons on top of the Twitter, Facebook and Instagram icons on the left side of the footer. I had tried to add a list and add and remove multiple styles in SCSS, but had issues with the footer contents being in disarray. Once this had been an issues for a few hours, I copied the footer tags and contents from the HTML file and the SCSS styling for the footer to a word document. I had slowly started introducing the content and styling back into the HTML and SCSS to see where the issues were starting. Once I had added a few lines of the content and styling, I tried different styling syntax which produced a desired result close to what I was aiming for to start with. 

I also had to try a variety of ways to keep the footer on the bottom of the page then had to readjust the SCSS styling syntax once I had added the blog posts. The styling had changed from fixed to relative for the footer position. 

Media Query - Once I had added the media query, the blog post images and text had separated, this was more of an issue for the views other than moobile.
