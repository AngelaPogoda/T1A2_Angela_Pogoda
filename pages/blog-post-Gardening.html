        <p>My mum has been an avid gardener for years. Creating our front and backyards from the perimeters inwards full of extremely well looked 
            after and interesting plants. There are quite a few plants that we have been able to eat from such as Spanish basil, blueberries, 
            oranges, lemons, dragon fruit and so much more. </p>
        <p>We have a large range of plants which aren't edible as well which include palm trees, succulents and ferns amongst others. I have definitely 
            been interested in gardening over the years but other interests have taken priority. I currently have a lot of succulent plants which I 
            repotted recently, a cactus and I am also growing carrots. I didn't know at the time of planting the carrots that they should be separated 
            especially if the plant is already established, otherwise they might not grow nearly as well as they could. I do hope to learn more and 
            have even more plants in the future. </p>
        <p>Please feel free to provide any plant tips and tricks by reaching out through the Contact Me page.</p>
