        <p>Rosies (2022)</p>
        <p>As mentioned in the Rosies blog post preview, I had come across Rosies after completing a 10km Darkness to Daylight run earlier this year.
            This run was rewarding in itself, but I was even happier that I had found another thing that I'm interested in. I signed up to be a 
            volunteer while at the Rosies stall and had been waiting to hear back. I had checked their website to see whether they had available spots 
            for volunteering. At this stage, they did have enough volunteers. I had waited a few months and mentioned Rosies to a couple of colleages, 
            one is already a volunteer and has been for a few years and the other had mentioned that Rosies were now taking more applications for the 
            areas I had mentioned. I recently applied and am very excited to start volunteering. They cover a large range of areas and have multiple 
            time slots available throughout the week and weekend, which is extremely helpful when working around other commitments such as work and 
            this Web Development bootcamp in particular.</p>
