        <p>I originally bought the mice as I went with one of my best friends to buy more pet mice since two of hers had passed away and she only had one left. 
            Mice are very social so we had visited a nearby petshop and I saw one male mouse that had the most interesting patterns. Due to her mouse at the time 
            being a female, we needed to buy more females and weren't able to buy a male. We chose two other female mice and had left the petshop. The following 
            day, I was very interested in purchasing the male mouse that we had seen, I had asked my best friend to see whether he was still available. After the 
            phone call to the petshop, she had told me that he had already been sold and I can understand why he was very popular. At this point, I wanted 
            to buy pet mice and she still wanted to buy a hairless one. I called various petshops over the next few days and had visited a different one to the 
            previous petshop which had mice that were only a month old. I had bought three being told and thinking that they were all males. Later that night, 
            I realised that one is a female and I didn't have another cage to separate her from her brothers. At this point, I had Jimmy-David, Julius Cheeser 
            and Eugenie. The same best friend, another friend and I named these mice.</p>
        <p>If you are interested, I do recommend starting to learn some Auslan signs, you might've not noticed that you've already used a few before!</p>
